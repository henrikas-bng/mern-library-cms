# Library CMS using MERN stack

Okay, so I just noticed how bad the formatting looks, it looks good in VSC, though.

It's probably due to extension `Prettier - Code formatter`.

## About the task

Main points were to make: an ability to login, browse only if you're logged in; add / edit / delete authors and their books.

If someone is reading this - I do understand that the code is bad, a lot of reusing of the same code, etc. But I just started learning the MERN stack, did this without any tutorials, too.

Maybe I'll refactor this one some time later, but now I'm going to develop more projects, without most mistakes I've done here. Learning, you know. Peace.
